# SportsStore

## (Reference: Pro ASP.NET Core 3, 8th Ed., Adam Freeman)

## Background

<P>With the author of the textbook, we've discussed some of the history, evolution, and uses of ASP.NET and the MVC design pattern. We have seen the structure of how the components fit together, and how to build web apps using templates and even a little of what it takes to work within the framework without using the pre-constructed templates.</p>

<p>The author discussed some features of the C# language that he considers essential, not to teach language fundamentals, but to set an expectation of understanding of the structures, usage, and development tools as an entry point to what his material will demonstrate. Consider the material leading up to this chapter the recommended pre-requisite coursework for the discussion to follow.</p>

<p>As a student who is new to the fundamentals of the C# language, there will be concepts and practices which at times will be familiar, and sometimes confusing. None is out of your reach. Take the time to understand it, not just copy, paste, and move on. As you have seen, with coding, there is often more than one way to do things. Learn from the examples, and when in doubt, ask!</p>

## Chap7 Instruction
<p>Complete the lab from Chapter 7 "SportsStore: A Real Application", pages 123 - 155.</p>

<p>Resist the temptation to copy/paste code content from the book. This may introduce hidden characters and have unintended consequences in your code. Pay attention to patterns. There is value in entering the code yourself, line-by-line.</p>

<p>Unit Testing is a part of this lab and is not optional.</p>
